                        in order to keep your saved places synchronized across your devices and prevent data loss when
                        reinstalling the app or switching devices. You can turn iCloud Sync off in the app settings.

                        analytics, tracking, or profiling. If you choose to search, reverse geocode coordinates, open a
                        destination in another app, or share a location link, the relevant search text, coordinates, or
                        language or locale preference may be transmitted as needed to complete that request. For place
                        search, coordinates may include the current map center or current location when available, so
                        the app can prioritize nearby or country-relevant results.

                        coordinates, and language or locale preference to a geocoding provider, currently LocationIQ,
                        only to return matching places or human-readable addresses.
